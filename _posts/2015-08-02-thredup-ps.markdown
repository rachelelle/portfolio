    During my summer internship at <a href="http://thredup.com">ThredUP</a>,the world's largest online fashion resale shop,  I was responsible for redesigning Personal Shops, a personalization feature that bookmarks product filters.
</section>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6 project-problem">
  		<h2 class="block-title">Problem</h2>
  		  Only a very small percentage of users onboarded to the feature, yet its users have the highest average order values.
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-6 project-role">
  	<h2 class="block-title">Role</h2>
  		My role was conducting user research and studies. I worked with multiple teams, such as Engineering, Design, and Marketing, in the process of developing specs and receiving feedback.
  	</div>
